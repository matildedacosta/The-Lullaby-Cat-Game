# The Lullaby Cat Game

##What is this game about?

The Lullaby Cat Game is a musical game. The goal is to get the cat to the bed on the other side of the canvas.
The cat moves closer to the bed with each correct question, and backwards when the answer is wrong.
When you win a level, the cat will suggest the next one, so you can further test your music theory knowledge.
